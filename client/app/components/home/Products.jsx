                description={"A cognitive humanoid head is an AI-enabled head-bot platform designed to emulate human cognitive abilities, including perception, thinking, learning, and decision-making. It uses natural language processing to interact with humans and recognizes individuals, facilitating seamless communication. The head-bot can imitate a range of expressions, engage visitors in general conversation, and identify individuals. Its skeleton is constructed from hexagonal PVC sheet blocks, forming a human-like head structure equipped with an LCD, camera, microphones, and speaker for enhanced functionality."}

The system integrates a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model with a Mediapipe-based hand recognition framework and a Random Forest classifier. Designed for real-time use on a Raspberry Pi, the TFLite model analyzes webcam input to detect a thumbs-up gesture, initiating a countdown. Once completed, the userâ€™s gesture is captured and classified, leveraging 3D hand landmarks extracted by Mediapipe and categorized using the Random Forest classifier."}
